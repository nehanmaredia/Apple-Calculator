# Apple-Calculator
This calculator application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a functional and visually appealing tool for performing arithmetic calculations. The HTML markup structures the calculator's layout, defining elements such as buttons for numbers, operations, and the result display. CSS styles are applied to enhance the visual presentation, including button styling, background colors, and layout design. JavaScript handles the interactive functionality, enabling users to input numbers, select operations, and view results dynamically. Together, these technologies create a seamless user experience for performing basic mathematical tasks within a web browser environment.
